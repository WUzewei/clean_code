# clean code question
## Student Information Management system

Attention: construct data from console is not required, do not implement that logic. Never write code use fgets scanf, getchr, cin or other functions to get input from console.

If you do need data for test, just set the value of variables.

Record the basic information of the students including: student ID, gender, age, class, interest groups,  each subject performance, home address, parents email address

Basic Requirement:

Subject performance only include three subjects: Engligh, Math, History.

Student record can be added, modified and deleted.

Query one student's information based on student ID

Generate each student's subject performance report and send it to the related parents' email address.(sending email functionality is just a stub. No need to implement it)

Query all students in one class

Extended Requirement：

Query all student in one interest group

Query one student's all interest groups

According to different class, student's subject performance report may have different subjects. Some class has English, Math,History subjects. Some may have physics, chemistry.

The mail style can be customized.

Can send mail to all students' parent email address who are in one interest group. (sending email functionality is just a stub. No need to implement it)

 

Note：

For clean code and UT certification，basic requirement is demanded.

For evolutionary design certification, both basic and extended requirement are demanded.
